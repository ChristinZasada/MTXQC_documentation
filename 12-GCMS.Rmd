# Protocols - GC-ToF-MS measurement

## Sample derivatisation

Materials:

- Methoxamine (MeOx)
- Pyridine (open under the hood only!)
- MSTFA
- Alkane mix (c10-c36) in Hexane
- chromacol vials and caps (big, small)

Mixtures:

- Solvent 1: 40 mg MeOx in 1 ml Pyridine
- Solvent 2: 10 ul Alkane mix in 1 ml MSTFA

Volumens of both solvents are shown for standard (small vol.) procedures.

Procedure:

- make sure samples are completly dry (1 h speed vac)
- add 20 ul (10 ul) of solvent 1 / sample
- incubate on rotary shaker, 30 C, for 60 min
- add 80 ul (25 ul) of solvent 2 / sample
- incubaate on rotary shaker, 37 C, for 90 min
- centrifuge to spin down insoluble materials
- prepare aliquotes three times 28 ul or two times 15 ul (small glass vials)
- keep on room temperature until measurement (max. 10 days)

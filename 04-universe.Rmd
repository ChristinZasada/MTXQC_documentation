# MTXQCvX2 Universe{#universe}

Back then in 2015 I started to think about a way how to evaluate my own datasets regarding some quality parameters. From a scratch of a few quality metrices evaluated in the frame of a very, very long Rscript until now many different generations of the MTXQC existed. 

Out of this evolution cycle MTXQC developed to a suit of modules that can be used complimentary in order to evaluate and process GC-MS derived metabolomics data. `MTXQC_part1.Rmd` represents the heart of this little universe. Besides that there are many ways how to use MTXQCvX2. Proposed workflows are illustrated in chapter [Workflow Maui](#wf:maui) and chapter [Workflow Metmax](#wf:metmax). The flow diagram introduced [here](\ref@fig:flow) might help you to decide how to get started.

The following sections give a short overview about the main parameters and functions of each module, its generated graphical illustrations and tables.

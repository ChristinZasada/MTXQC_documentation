## Introduction
This document describes how to use MTXQCvX2 in combination with metmax^[http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/apps/metmax/default.htm].

Historically, MTXQCvX2 has been developed and optimized for Maui-derived input files. The `MTXQCvX2-part4.Rmd` functions as a converter of metmax-derived files in order to create suitable input formats for MTXQCvX-part1. This module could also be used to convert tables derived from other programs as long as they are confirm with the herein described tables. Mandatory columns are referenced in the text.

The general workflow of the NMTXQCvX2 project is briefly shown below in **quick view**. More detailed instructions are summarised in the following paragraphs. For more detailed explanations about the individual input parameter for each module of MTXQCvX2 please proceed to read the documentation about the individual modules and their knitting parameter. The relation of knitting parameter, input and output files are described in each section.

## Quick view

1. Generate input files: run `MTXQC_part4.Rmd`^[read here the instructions]
2. Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files
3. Knit with parameter: `MTXQC_init.Rmd`
4. Copy input files into corresponding folders
5. Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files^[Details further down this document]
6. Update metabolite names in `conversion_metabolite.csv`^[Column: Metabolite_manual]
7. Define the internal standard and/or alkanes^[Also in conversion_metabolite.csv; see below paragraph Standards]
8. Knit with parameter: `MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd`
9. Knit with parameter: `MTXQC_part1.Rmd`
10. Knit with parameter: `MTXQC_part2.Rmd`
11. If required - proceed with `MTXQC_part3.Rmd` - ManualValidation


## Required input files derived from a ChromaToF/Metmax

If you need an introduction about how to use metmax - have a look at the separate documentation `Metmax_intro`.

The chapter Workflows for Metmax-extracted data explains in detail how to use this module to generate suitable input files. Depending on your experiment you can select the kind of data that is extracted and transformed by the `MTXQCvX_part4`.

## Annotation-file
The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - **File and Type** - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of absence MTXQCvX_part1 stops processing and shows an error message.

A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below:

1. Copy all file names from a file of your choice
2. Paste & transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A
3. Give it the column name: File
4. Optional: Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A
5. Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample or addQ1_dilution^[see for further details additionalQuant]
6. Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment ...^[optimal: two-three parameter, max: four parameter. Consider possible combinations, e.g., HCT116-control, HCT116-BPTES]
7. Save the content as `csv-file` in the `psirm_glucose/input/...`

## Sample_extracts-file

The sample_extracts.csv file helps to determine correct absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the `CalculationFileData.csv`.

This file requires two obligatory columns and have to be included: **Extract_vol** and **Unit**^[Define: count, mg or ul]. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets.  
The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder `psirm_glucose/input/...`. 

If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing.

A template file can be modified and reused: `inst/template_files/...` 

## Conversion_metabolite.csv 

This file, saved in `config_mtx/`serves as a translational table. It defines alternative version of metabolite library names for the use in plotting your data. It is also used to define settings and standard classifications. 

Detailed information for each column of the file are shown here: REF

### Match your annotation with library names

Prior the analysis you need to match the names of your intermediates with the conversion_metabolite.csv file. You need to add the corresponding name for each intermediate in the column **Metabolite_manual**.

General suggestion for naming conventions in ChromaToF: Metabolite_Derivate, optional in case of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP. An example for both: Lactic acid_(2TMS) or Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP.

If you have annotated intermediates that are not included so far in this table please follow the instructions how to extend `conversion_metabolite.csv`.

### Define your internal standards and alkanes

MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in `conversion_metabolite.csv` by adding the tag InternalStandard in the column Standard. 

If you check the box - InternalStandard the module searches in your input file containing peak areas for the defined standard and extracts the information. It also generated the file `InternalStandard.csv` and stores it at `psirm_glucose/input/gc/`.

In the same way alkanes are be defined in conversion_metabolite.csv. Each alkane has to be flag tagged with **Alk** in the column Standard. This gives you the opportunity to implement customized mixtures of alkanes in order to determine the retention index. 
MTXQCvX_part4 recognises the flag tag and generates based on peakarea-file `Alcane_intensities.csv` and saves it at `psirm_glucose/input/gc/`^[It should be al_k_ane, I know, but Maui doesn't...].

The in-lab approach considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., #c10. If you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index.

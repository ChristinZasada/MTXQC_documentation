It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). Both workflows are introduced in the distinct chapters including their required input parameter (chapter ??). Technical relevant information are summarised in chapter ??. "],

It does not matter if you have performed an experiment including stable isotopes or if you just aim for the quantification of a few intermediates. 3.2 Quick view Setup a new R-project and copy MTXQC template files and folders Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd and create project folder, e.g., psirm_glucose Copy input files and rename ManualQuantTable.tsv (e18205cz.tsv) Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files Define the internal extraction standard Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required, proceed with MTXQC_part3.Rmd for ManualValidation 3.3 Input files Three different kind of export functions have been implemented in Maui. These functions provide the export of the actual data into .csv or .tsv files that are directly usable as input files for MTXQCvX2. Please refer to section 12.4.1.5 how you perform the export and which containers have to be exported using what export function and where to copy them in psirm_glucose/input/. Certain circumstances might wish you to combine multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have only to work with a single file CalculationFileData.csv1 containing all data of the your experiment. The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the exported files from different Maui projects. The script combine-sets.R2 automatically saves all combined files into the correct input folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has been taken care of for you. Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., psirm_glucose/) a new folder called raw-data Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in psirm_glucose/raw_data/... Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether Update the parameter of combine-sets.R, meaning folder name definitions, file Execute the R script Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding folder: psirm_glucose/input-folder/gc/... or psirm_glucose/input-folder/inc/... Copy the renamed ManualQuantTable.tsv files of each Maui project into psirm_glucose/input/quant/... 3.4 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: Copy the first row / header of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A Change the first entry: Metabolite -&gt; File Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample or addQ1_dilution3 Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment4 Save the content as csv-file in the psirm_glucose/input/... 3.5 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit5. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 3.6 Internal Standard MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the conversion_metabolite.csv file. To do so, add InternalStandard to the compound in last column Standard. For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated in Maui. Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from a distinct container called cinAcid. The exported file has to be renamed to InternalStandard.csv though and moved to psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the Maui export file quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv file and save it in the folder psirm_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv, respectively. Prerequisite - you have annotated the compound in Maui. The report of MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd includes the defined internal standard for each project in a message. stored in psirm_glucose/output/quant/...↩ inst/template_files/…↩ see for further details additionalQuant↩ optimal: two-three parameter, max: four parameter.

Historically, MTXQCvX2 has been developed and optimized for Maui-derived input files. The MTXQCvX2-part4.Rmd functions as a converter of metmax-derived files in order to create suitable input formats for MTXQCvX-part1.Rmd. This module could also be used to convert tables derived from other programs as long as they are stick with the herein described table formats. Mandatory columns are referenced in the text for each kind of input file. The general workflow of the NMTXQCvX2 project is briefly shown below in quick view. More detailed instructions are summarised in the following paragraphs. For more detailed explanations about the individual input parameter for each module of MTXQCvX2 please proceed to read the documentation about the individual modules and their knitting parameter. The relation of knitting parameter, input and output files are described in each section. 4.3 Quick view Generate input files: run MTXQC_part4.Rmd7 Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files into corresponding folders Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files8 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv9 Define the internal standard and/or alkanes10 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with MTXQC_part3.Rmd for ManualValidation 4.4 Input files If you need an introduction about how to use metmax - have a look at the separate documentation Metmax_intro. The chapter ?? MTXQCvX_part4 explains in detail how to use this module to generate suitable input files. 4.5 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: Copy all file names from a file of your choice Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A Call column A -&gt; File Optional: Remove any non-file name entry in this column Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample, Q1_diluation, ,addQ1_dilution11 Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment12 Save the content as csv-file in the psirm_glucose/input/... 4.6 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit13. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 4.7 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv The file conversion_metabolite.csv, saved in config_mtx/, serves as a kind of translational table. It defines alternative version of metabolite library names that come in handy to plot data using shorter metabolite names. This file is also used to define settings and standard classifications. Detailed information for each column of the file are shown here: REF 4.7.1 Match your annotation with library names Prior the analysis you need to match the names of your intermediates with the conversion_metabolite.csv file. You need to update or add the corresponding name for each intermediate in the column Metabolite_manual. General suggestion for naming conventions in ChromaToF: Metabolite_Derivate, e.g., Lactic acid_(2TMS). In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use: Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP. If you have annotated intermediates that are not included so far in this table please follow the instructions how to extend conversion_metabolite.csv.REF 4.7.2 Define your internal standards and alkanes MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in conversion_metabolite.csv by adding the tag InternalStandard in the column Standard. If you check the box - InternalStandard in the parameter selection for MTXQCvX2_part4.Rmd the module searches in your input file for peak areas of the defined standard and extracts the information. It also generates the file InternalStandard.csv and stores it at psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... In the same way alkanes are defined in conversion_metabolite.csv. Each alkane has to be flag tagged with Alk in the column Standard. This gives you the opportunity to implement customized mixtures of alkanes in order to determine the retention index. MTXQCvX_part4.Rmd recognises the flag tag and generates Alcane_intensities.csv based on your input file containing peak areas and saves it in psirm_glucose/input/gc/...14. The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., #c10. If you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index. http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/apps/metmax/default.htm↩ read here the instructions↩ Details further down this document↩ Column: Metabolite_manual↩ Also in conversion_metabolite.csv; see below paragraph Standards↩ see for further details additionalQuant↩ optimal: two-three parameter, max: four parameter.

The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table 1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end up with weird imported dataframes in R. Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search17 or using statistical compare. pSIRM experiments require the definition of pTop5 masses18 instead of top5 masses in the reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced by the application of stable isotopes19 name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.76 15423 135444 465486 Pyr 174 1042 0.65 56978 46888 4354544 Cit 273 1805 0.99 1326 23321 132121 MTXQCvX_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of the peak areas file and saves it20.

Fragments for each intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax at Tools/Options/metabolite masses. They can be imported24 or manually specified each by each. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2. The output has to be saved as csv-file, including the deletion of the partial row column.load, respectively25. name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.85 31026 5165829 5829 Lac 220 1051 0.85 3607 662277 277 Lac 221 1051 0.85 1222 111481 81 Lac 222 1051 0.85 188 1003494 10023 Lac 223 1051 0.85 0 33542 342 MTXQCvX_part4 calculates the stable isotope incorporation and exports DataMatrix.csv as well as pSIRM_SpectraData.csv26. The mathematics behind are outlined in (Pietzke et al. 2014) Important: Extracted MIDs have to match with defined mass couples for each metabolite in MTXQCvX227. Please refer for more details to vignettes/config_mtx-files. 10.2.3 Derivatisation efficiency - mz73.csv28 The extraction of intensities for the ion \\(m/z\\) 73 works analogous to the extraction of MIDs29. Mass ranges have to be defined for each intermediate for the mass 73 by defining starting and end mass with 73. MTXQCvX_part4 generates the file MassSum-73.csv30.

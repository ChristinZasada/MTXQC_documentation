["index.html", "MTXQCvX2 documentation Chapter1 Welcome", " MTXQCvX2 documentation Christin Zasada 2018-10-24 Chapter1 Welcome This documentation introduced to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). Both workflows are introduced in the distinct chapters including their required input parameter (chapter 4). Technical relevant information are summarised in chapter 7. "],

["workflows.html", "Chapter4 Workflows for MTXQCvX2 4.1 Maui 4.2 Metmax", " Chapter4 Workflows for MTXQCvX2 4.1 Maui The following article describes briefly how to use MTXQCvX2 in case you used Maui for the annotation of your metabolomics project. It does not matter if you have performed an experiment including stable isotopes or if you just aim for the quantification of a few intermediates. A summary of the general workflow is shown below, followed by more detailed instructions explaining required input files. Check out the notes for hints and suggestions. In order to run smoothly through the overall procedure you should meet the following prerequisites: A succesfull Maui project Exported all required container (see 4.1.2) Sequence list and experimental conditions Extraction procedure and corresponding volumes, cell counts 4.1.1 Quick view Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files1 Knit with parameter:$MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files Define the internal standard2 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd$ Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with ManualValidation 4.1.2 Input files derived from a single Maui-Project Input-Folder: gc Alcane_intensities.csv (Diagnostics/Export Alcane intensities) InternalStandard.csv3 MassSum-73.csv (Diagnostics/QC Mass Sum Export for mass 73) PeakDensities-Chroma.csv (Diagnostics/ExportPeakDensities) Input-Folder: quant ManualQuantTable.tsv - rename it - e.g., e18125cz.tsv45 quantMassAreasMatrix.csv (Quantification export of samplesPeakGroups) Input-Folder: inc DataMatrix.csv (Export % Label of pSIRM-samplesPeakGroups) pSIRM_SpectraData.csv (pSIRM Spectra Export)6 4.1.3 Multiple MAUI-projects Certain circumstances might require the combination of multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., psirm_glucose/) a new folder, e.g., raw-data Create subfolder for each MAUI-run in psirm_glucose/raw_data Copy the required input files into each subfolder Update the parameter of template file combine-sets.R file7 Execute the script Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding input-folder/gc or input-folder/inc Copy the renamed tsv-files separately into input/quant/… 4.1.4 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type are obligatory and in the case of absence MTXQCvX_part1 stops and shows an error message. Copy first row of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File Rename Metabolite into File Remove QuantMasses (last entry of the column) Add column Type and specify either as sample or addQ1_dilution8 Add further columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment …9 Save as csv-file (folder: input/…) 4.1.5 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file helps to determine correct absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. Two columns are obligatory and have to be included: Extract_vol and Unit10. Please specify for each experimental condition that differs in extracted quantities. Column names of the experimental conditions have to match with the annotation file. Otherwise MTXQCvX2_part1 stops processing and throws an error message in the report. An example file can be modified and reused11. Save the created file as csv-file into the input folder as well. 4.1.6 Internal Standard MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in the conversion_metabolite.csv file12. Peak areas for the defined compound are either generated by the export of cinAcidPeakGroups container in Maui, or could be extracted from the samplePeakGroups.csv file. Peak areas should be copied into a new csv-file and named InternalStandard. CinAcid-derived exported file shou be renamed, respectively. The defined internal standards are listed with their complete name in the MTXQC report. 4.2 Metmax This document describes how to use MTXQCvX213 in combination with metmax14. Historically, MTXQCvX2 has been developed and optimized for Maui-derived input files. The MTXQCvX2-part4 functions as a converter of metmax-derived files in order to create suitable input formats for MTXQCvX-part1. This module could also be used to convert tables derived from other programs as long as they are confirm with the herein described tables. Mandatory columns are referenced in the text. The general workflow of the NMTXQCvX2 project is briefly shown below in quick view. More detailed instructions are summarised in the following paragraphs. For more detailed explanations about the individual input parameter for each module of MTXQCvX2 please proceed to read the documentation about the individual modules and their knitting parameter15. The relation of knitting parameter, input and output files are described in each section. 4.2.1 Quick view Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files16 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv17 Define the internal standard and/or alkanes18 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part4.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with MTXQC_part3 - ManualValidation19 4.2.2 Input files derived from a ChromaToF/Metmax-Project If you need an introduction about how to use metmax have a look at the separate documentation20. Quantification - PeakAreas.csv21 You need a file containing all extracted peak areas for each metabolite and file22. The header of metmax-extracted files looks like shown below (see table 1). Please, remember to delete the second header row, representing the column loads for each file before saving as csv-file. Otherwise you end up with weird imported dataframes in R. Quantification masses have to be updated while processing in ChromaToF prior the export of the data e.g., with a reference search23 or using statistical compare. pSIRM experiments require the definition of pTop5 masses24 instead of top5 masses in the reference in order to take into account the shift of intensities induced by the application of stable isotopes25 (#tab:metmax_header)Example metmax-extracted file containing peak areas. name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.76 15423 135444 465486 Pyr 174 1042 0.65 56978 46888 4354544 Cit 273 1805 0.99 1326 23321 132121 MTXQCvX_part4 takes care of the formatting and correct column names of the peak areas file and saves it26. MTXQCvX_part4 generates also the file PeakDensities-Chroma.csv27, in case you have selected the option to include sum of area normalisation while knitting this module. Isotope incorporation - MIDs.csv28 In order to determine the incorporation of stable isotopes MTXQCvX2 requires as an input the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs) for each intermediate and measurement29. Fragments for each intermediate have to be pre-defined in metmax at Tools/Options/metabolite masses. They can be imported30 or manually specified each by each. An example of the metmax output is shown in table 2. The output has to be saved as csv-file, including the deletion of the partial row column.load, respectively31. (#tab:metmax_header_mid)Example metmax-extracted file containing MIDs. name mass ri row.load file_1 file_2 file_x Lac 219 1051 0.85 31026 5165829 5829 Lac 220 1051 0.85 3607 662277 277 Lac 221 1051 0.85 1222 111481 81 Lac 222 1051 0.85 188 1003494 10023 Lac 223 1051 0.85 0 33542 342 MTXQCvX_part4 calculates the stable isotope incorporation and exports DataMatrix.csv as well as pSIRM_SpectraData.csv32. The mathematics behind are outlined in (Pietzke et al. 2014) Important: Extracted MIDs have to match with defined mass couples for each metabolite in MTXQCvX233. Please refer for more details to vignettes/config_mtx-files. Derivatisation efficiency - mz73.csv34 The extraction of intensities for the ion \\(m/z\\) 73 works analogous to the extraction of MIDs35. Mass ranges have to be defined for each intermediate for the mass 73 by defining starting and end mass with 73. MTXQCvX_part4 generates the file MassSum-73.csv36. Check inst\\template_files\\ for reference. Hopefully soon a new metmax button extracting specific intensities across the batch. 4.2.3 Further required input-files Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type are obligatory and in the case of absence MTXQCvX_part1 stops and shows an error message. Copy first row of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File, first column Rename Metabolite -&gt; File Remove all other entries than file names (e.g., mass, ri) Add column Type and specify either as sample or addQ1_dilution37 Add further columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment …38 Save as csv-file39 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file helps to determine correct absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. Two columns are obligatory and have to be included: Extract_vol and Unit40. Please specify for each experimental condition that differs in extracted quantities. Column names of the experimental conditions have to match with the annotation file. Otherwise MTXQCvX2_part1 stops processing and throws an error message in the report. An example file can be modified and reused41. Save the created file as csv-file into the input folder as well42. Conversion_metabolite.csv - Metabolite_manual Prior the analysis you need to match the names of your intermediates with the conversion_metabolite.csv file. You need to add the corresponding name for each intermediate in the column Metabolite_manual. General suggestion for naming conventions in ChromaToF: Metabolite_Derivate, optional in case of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP. An example for both: Lactic acid_(2TMS) or Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP. Missing intermediate can be added to this list. If you want to do so, please consultate the vignette/config_mtx first and follow the corresponding instructions how to extend conversion_metabolite.csv. Conversion_metabolite.csv - Standards MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in the conversion_metabolite.csv file43. Accordingly, MTXQCvX+part4 extracts peak areas from peakarea-file and generates InternalStandard.csv44. In the same way alkanes are be defined in conversion_metabolite.csv. Each alkane has to be flag tagged with Alk in the column Standard45. This gives you the opportunity to implement customizes mixtures of alkanes in order to determine the retention index. The in-lab approach considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. MTXQCvX_part4 recognises the flag tag and generates based on peakarea-file Alcane_intensities.csv46. References "],

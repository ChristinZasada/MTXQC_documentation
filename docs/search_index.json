["index.html", "MTXQCvX2 documentation Chapter1 Welcome", " MTXQCvX2 documentation Christin Zasada 2018-10-24 Chapter1 Welcome This documentation introduced to you how to use MTXQCvX2 in order to assess the quality of your GC-MS derived data, perform the determination of calibration curves and absolute quantification. It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). Both workflows are introduced in the distinct chapters including their required input parameter (chapter 4). Technical relevant information are summarised in chapter 7. "],

["workflows.html", "Chapter4 Workflows for MTXQCvX2 4.1 Maui", " Chapter4 Workflows for MTXQCvX2 4.1 Maui The following article describes briefly how to use MTXQCvX2 in case you used Maui for the annotation of your metabolomics project. It does not matter if you have performed an experiment including stable isotopes or if you just aim for the quantification of a few intermediates. A summary of the general workflow is shown below, followed by more detailed instructions explaining required input files. Check out the notes for hints and suggestions. In order to run smoothly through the overall procedure you should meet the following prerequisites: A succesfull Maui project Exported all required container (see 4.1.2) Sequence list and experimental conditions Extraction procedure and corresponding volumes, cell counts 4.1.1 Quick view Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files1 Knit with parameter:$MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files Define the internal standard2 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd$ Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with ManualValidation 4.1.2 Input files derived from a single Maui-Project Input-Folder: gc Alcane_intensities.csv (Diagnostics/Export Alcane intensities) InternalStandard.csv3 MassSum-73.csv (Diagnostics/QC Mass Sum Export for mass 73) PeakDensities-Chroma.csv (Diagnostics/ExportPeakDensities) Input-Folder: quant ManualQuantTable.tsv - rename it - e.g., e18125cz.tsv45 quantMassAreasMatrix.csv (Quantification export of samplesPeakGroups) Input-Folder: inc DataMatrix.csv (Export % Label of pSIRM-samplesPeakGroups) pSIRM_SpectraData.csv (pSIRM Spectra Export)6 4.1.3 Multiple MAUI-projects Certain circumstances might require the combination of multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. Create in the MTXQC-project folder a new folder, e.g., raw-data Create subfolder for each MAUI-run Copy the required files into each subfolder Update the parameter of combine-sets.R file7 Execute the script Merged files have been generated and copied into input-folder Copy the renamed tsv-files separately into input/quant/… 4.1.4 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type are obligatory and in the case of absence MTXQCvX_part1 stops and shows an error message. Copy first row of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File Rename Metabolite into File Remove QuantMasses (last entry of the column) Add column Type and specify either as sample or addQ1_dilution8 Add further columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment …9 Save as csv-file (folder: input/…) 4.1.5 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file helps to determine correct absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. Two columns are obligatory and have to be included: Extract_vol and Unit10. Please specify for each experimental condition that differs in extracted quantities. Column names of the experimental conditions have to match with the annotation file. Otherwise MTXQCvX2_part1 stops processing and throws an error message in the report. An example file can be modified and reused11. Save the created file as csv-file into the input folder as well. 4.1.6 Internal Standard MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in the conversion_metabolite.csv file12. Peak areas for the defined compound are either generated by the export of cinAcidPeakGroups container in Maui, or could be extracted from the samplePeakGroups.csv file. Peak areas should be copied into a new csv-file and named InternalStandard. CinAcid-derived exported file shou be renamed, respectively. The defined internal standards are listed with their complete name in the MTXQC report.

It furthermore provides you two normalisation strategies and the calculation of quantities in, e.g., pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue. MTXQCvX2 does also enable the calculation of stable isotopic incorporation and the evaluation of the underlying data, the mass isotopomer distributions (MIDs). The tool has been set up to support the in-lab developed workflow for quantitative metabolomics experiments using the in-house developed software Maui for the annotation of data. MTXQCvX2 bridges the gap between quality control and first data post-processing / analysis of GC-MS derived data (MTXQCvX2_part1, MTXQCvX2_part2). Nevertheless MTXQCvX2 includes a module in order to integrate all kind of data provided in spreadsheet-format, e.g., derived from metmax, extracting required information and creating corresponding files (MTXQCvX2_part4). Both workflows are introduced in the distinct chapters including their required input parameter (chapter Workflow Maui and Workflow Metmax). "],

From a scratch of a few quality metrices evaluated in the frame of a very, very long Rscript until now many different generations of the MTXQC existed. Out of this evolution cycle MTXQC developed to a suit of modules that can be used complimentary in order to evaluate and process GC-MS derived metabolomics data. MTXQC_part1.Rmd represents the heart of this little universe. Besides that there are many ways how to use MTXQCvX2. Proposed workflows are illustrated in chapter Workflow Maui and chapter Workflow Metmax. The flow diagram introduced here might help you to decide how to get started.

It does not matter if you have performed an experiment including stable isotopes or if you just aim for the quantification of a few intermediates. 4.2 Quick view Setup a new R-project and copy MTXQC template files and folders Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd and create project folder, e.g., psirm_glucose Copy input files and rename ManualQuantTable.tsv (e18205cz.tsv) Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files Define the internal extraction standard Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required, proceed with MTXQC_part3.Rmd for ManualValidation 4.3 Input files Three different kind of export functions have been implemented in Maui. These functions provide the export of the actual data into .csv or .tsv files that are directly usable as input files for MTXQCvX2. Please refer to section 9.3 how you perform the export and which containers have to be exported using what export function and where to copy them in psirm_glucose/input/. Certain circumstances might wish you to combine multiple MAUI-projects into one MTXQC-project. This might be the case when you run the same samples in split and splitless mode on the machine or your experimental setup has been measured in multiple batches in order to avoid derivatisation effects. It is highly recommended to combine the input files derived from a different Maui projects beforehand the analysis. In that way you have only to work with a single file CalculationFileData.csv1 containing all data of the your experiment. The herein described process provides a quick way how to combine the exported files from different Maui projects. The script combine-sets.R2 automatically saves all combined files into the correct input folder. Just update the folder and subfolder names. All the rest has been taken care of for you. Create in the MTXQC-project folder (e.g., psirm_glucose/) a new folder called raw-data Create a subfolder for each Maui-project in psirm_glucose/raw_data/... Copy into this folder all your Maui-derived input files altogether Update the parameter of combine-sets.R, meaning folder name definitions, file Execute the R script Merged files have been generated and copied into the corresponding folder: psirm_glucose/input-folder/gc/... or psirm_glucose/input-folder/inc/... Copy the renamed ManualQuantTable.tsv files of each Maui project into psirm_glucose/input/quant/... 4.4 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message. A quick way to generate an annotation file is described below: Copy the first row / header of quantMassAreaMatrix.csv file Paste &amp; transpose the content into a new Excel-File into column A Change the first entry: Metabolite -&gt; File Remove the entry QuantMasses at the very end of the column A Add the column Type and specify each file either as sample or addQ1_dilution3 Add more columns specifying your experimental conditions, e.g., Cellline and Treatment4 Save the content as csv-file in the psirm_glucose/input/... 4.5 Sample_extracts-file The sample_extracts.csv file is required in order to determine automatically absolute quantities in the manner of pmol/1e+6 cells or pmol/mg tissue in the CalculationFileData.csv. This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit5. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 4.6 Internal Standard MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal extraction standards. The only thing you need to do is to define the corresponding compounds as an internal standard in the conversion_metabolite.csv file. To do so, add InternalStandard to the compound in last column Standard. For an classical pSIRM experiment in the Kempa lab we are using cinnamic acid. The evaluation of this compound has been integrated in Maui. Peak areas of cinnamic acid are exported from a distinct container called cinAcid. The exported file has to be renamed to InternalStandard.csv though and moved to psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... If you have used a different compound as an internal extraction standard you might need to extract the peak areas of this compound from the Maui export file quantPeakAreasMatrix.csv file and save it in the folder psirm_glucose/input/gc/InternalStandard.csv, respectively.

Historically, MTXQCvX2 has been developed and optimized for Maui-derived input files. The MTXQCvX2-part4.Rmd functions as a converter of metmax-derived files in order to create suitable input formats for MTXQCvX-part1.Rmd. This module could also be used to convert tables derived from other programs as long as they are stick with the herein described table formats. Mandatory columns are referenced in the text for each kind of input file. The general workflow of the NMTXQCvX2 project is briefly shown below in quick view. More detailed instructions are summarised in the following paragraphs. For more detailed explanations about the individual input parameter for each module of MTXQCvX2 please proceed to read the documentation about the individual modules and their knitting parameter. The relation of knitting parameter, input and output files are described in each section. 5.3 Quick view Generate input files: run MTXQC_part4.Rmd7 Setup R-project and copy MTXQC-files Knit with parameter: MTXQC_init.Rmd Copy input files into corresponding folders Create annotation.csv and sample_extracts.csv files8 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv9 Define the internal standard and/or alkanes10 Knit with parameter: MTXQC_ExperimentalSetup.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part1.Rmd Knit with parameter: MTXQC_part2.Rmd If required - proceed with MTXQC_part3.Rmd for ManualValidation 5.4 Input files If you need an introduction about how to use metmax - have a look at the separate documentation Metmax_intro. The chapter ?? MTXQCvX_part4 explains in detail how to use this module to generate suitable input files. 5.5 Annotation-file The annotation file relate file names with experimental conditions or specify quantification standards in your batch. Two columns - File and Type - are obligatory and have to be present in the annotation file. In the case of their absence MTXQCvX_part1.Rmd stops processing and shows an error message.

This file requires two obligatory columns - Extract_vol and Unit13. Please specify for each experimental condition the amount of extracted cells (count), tissue (mg) or volume of blood/plasme (ul) in the unit shown in the brackets. The names of the columns of the experimental conditions have to match up with the annotation file. Save the file in the folder psirm_glucose/input/.... If the defined experimental conditions do not match up with the annotation MTXQCvX2_part1.Rmd exit data processing. A template file is saved for review and usage at inst/template_files/... 5.7 Update metabolite names in conversion_metabolite.csv The file conversion_metabolite.csv, saved in config_mtx/, serves as a kind of translational table. It defines alternative version of metabolite library names that come in handy to plot data using shorter metabolite names. This file is also used to define settings and standard classifications. Detailed information for each column of the file are shown here: REF 5.7.1 Match your annotation with library names Prior the analysis you need to match the names of your intermediates with the conversion_metabolite.csv file. You need to update or add the corresponding name for each intermediate in the column Metabolite_manual. General suggestion for naming conventions in ChromaToF: Metabolite_Derivate, e.g., Lactic acid_(2TMS). In case of the presence of main- (MP) and byproducts (BP) use: Metabolite_Derivate_MP/BP, e.g., Glucose_(1MEOX)(5TMS)_MP. If you have annotated intermediates that are not included so far in this table please follow the instructions how to extend conversion_metabolite.csv.REF 5.7.2 Define your internal standards and alkanes MTXQCvX2 allows the specification of project-specific internal standards. Corresponding compounds have to be marked as an internal standard in conversion_metabolite.csv by adding the tag InternalStandard in the column Standard. If you check the box - InternalStandard in the parameter selection for MTXQCvX2_part4.Rmd the module searches in your input file for peak areas of the defined standard and extracts the information. It also generates the file InternalStandard.csv and stores it at psirm_glucose/input/gc/.... In the same way alkanes are defined in conversion_metabolite.csv. Each alkane has to be flag tagged with Alk in the column Standard. This gives you the opportunity to implement customized mixtures of alkanes in order to determine the retention index. MTXQCvX_part4.Rmd recognises the flag tag and generates Alcane_intensities.csv based on your input file containing peak areas and saves it in psirm_glucose/input/gc/...14. The in-lab protocol considers nine alkanes from c10 to c36. Standard annotation includes an hashtag, e.g., #c10. If you use this annotation even Metmax would be able to determine the retention index. http://gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/apps/metmax/default.htm↩ read here the instructions↩ Details further down this document↩ Column: Metabolite_manual↩ Also in conversion_metabolite.csv; see below paragraph Standards↩ see for further details additionalQuant↩ optimal: two-three parameter, max: four parameter.

["psirm.html", "Chapter 7 pSIRM experiments 7.1 Experimental design 7.2 Experimental procedures 7.3 Protocol pSIRM 7.4 Hints &amp; notes", " Chapter 7 pSIRM experiments The application of stable isotopes provides a powerful tool to track the activity of metabolic pathways. the time-dependent and atom-specific routing along a metabolic pathway resolved how substrates like glucose or glutamine are used in order to maintain a certain phenotype and energetic homeostatsis. We developed an approach called pulsed stable isotope resolved metabolomics (pSIRM) enabling the quantitative evaluation of metabolite pool sizes and incorporation of stable isotopes, e.g., \\(^{13}C_6\\)-glucose. A thoughtful setup of the experimental design including the applied substrates and carefull experimental handling are prerequisites for a successful pSIRM experiment. Essential aspects are collected in the below paragraphs along with a number of usefull tweaks. 7.1 Experimental design An in vitro pSIRM experiment lasts in total up to three days starting from the cell seeding at day zero. Further along the way up to two media changes should be included until the application of stable isotopes and harvesting the cells maintaining the continouse availability of nutrients and avoiding the accumulation of waste products (Figure (fig:psirm)). The media change four hours prior the harvest is set up in order to give cells time to recover from the mechanical stress of the media change. At the time point of harvest cells should be in a perfect happily state regarding metabolic environment and stress. Choose carefully the seeding density of you cells in the first place. High confluency inducing contact inhibition of cell growth has a strong impact on several cellular processes including the uptake of nutrients. Try to aim for petri dishes with a maximum confluency of 75-80 %. A pre-experiment including different cell densities for seeding at a number of experimental conditions helps you to get a feeling for the cell growth in general and an expected output of cells at the time point of the harvest. Later one is useful to plan sample extraction and measurement subsequently. Figure 7.1: Experimental design of a pSIRM experiment distuingishing short and long labeling with stable isotopes. For adherent cell cultures only: Include for each experimental condition an additional petri dish that is solely used to determine the cell count at the time point of your harvest. This additional plate ensures a correct determination of absolute quantities and might reduce variation of pool sizes in the statistical analysis15. Think carefully about control conditions and include cell culture dishes that are not labeled. These dishes function as a control for your labeling procedure and the natural abundance of isotopes. 7.2 Experimental procedures There is a slight difference in the protocols for adherent and suspension cells. Please read instructions and footnotes carefully. Short16 and long term labeling procured differ only in the applied solvents during the labeling - either label buffer (LB) only or a combination of full label medium (LM) and label buffer (LB). Latter one is applied in order to remove extracellular metabolites of the media. Both label buffer and media contain the major nutrients / stable isotopes to keep the main substrates at constant supply at all times (Table 7.1). During the application of stable isotopes longer than a few minutes cells might sense the absence of further intermediates provided during standard cell culture procedure and and adjust their metabolic program accordingly. Table 7.1: Solvent composition of Full label medium (LM) and label buffer (BF) for a pSIRM experiment labeling with 13C-glucose. Solvent Base Carbon.source Supplements Full label medium (LM) DMEM, without glucose, glutamine, pyruvate 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) small molecules (inhibitor, antibiotics) Label buffer (LB) HEPES (5 mM), NaCl (140 mM), pH 7.4 13C-Glc (2.5 g/L) 12C-Gln (2 mM) The quality of your data later heavily relies on the exact handling of the cells and a consistent timing throughout the pSIRM experiment. Especially the step removing the LB and quenching the cells should be a matter of a tenth of seconds rather than seconds. It is of great value to perform the cell harvest with a second person. 7.3 Protocol pSIRM 7.3.1 Adherent cell cultures The herein described protocols are detailed explanations how to perform a pSIRM cell harvest for long term label application. If you want to label for less than 2 minutes omit solely omit steps 6-8. Materials: Cell culture dishes, max. confluency 80 % Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish)17 Label buffer (LB) supplemented with substrates (5 ml / dish) Ice-cold 50 % MeOH supplemented with 2 ug/ul cinnamic acid 2x 5 ml pipette and tips18 Beaker Ice 15 ml falcons (chloroform resistant) Cell lifter Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LB and LM in the water bath Take a number of petri dishes (condition-wise including all biol. replicates) Discard cell culture media Carefully add long term labeling LM OR short term labeling: LB Incubate cells on the bench or in an incubator Discard LM (beaker) Add immediatly 5 ml of LB Rotate dish once in order to cover complete surface Meanwhile 2nd person get prepared with 5 ml ice-cold MeOH Discard LB into beaker and immediatly 2nd person quenches with ice-cold MeOH Collect cell extracts using cell lifter Transfer cell extracts into 15 ml falcons Store falcons on ice until further processing Repeat this procedure (step 6-10) for all dishes of a single condition first. Once MeOH is added metabolic processes are interrupted and cell extracts can be collected with the help of cell lifter without rush and subsequently transfered to 15 ml falcon and stored on ice until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction methanolic extracts). Determine the cell count using your additional petri dishes for each condition. 7.3.2 Supension cell cultures Materials: Cell culture flasks Labeling media (LM) supplemented with substrates 5 ml pipette and tips19 1 ml pipette Beaker paper tissues Liquid nitrogen 15 ml falcons 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes Biological waste bin next to your bench Procedure: Pre-warm LM in the water bath Determine the cell count of your cell suspension(s) Take aliquots of \\(10-15e+6\\) cells and transfer into 15 ml falcon Spin down cells very gently 300 g, 2 min at room temperature Discard media into beaker Resuspend cells gently in three-times 1 ml20 Incubate and keep warm Fractionate cell supension in three eppendorf tubes (3x 1 ml each) Spin down quickly in top-bench centrifuge21 Discard media blandtly on paper tissues Snap-freeze immediatly in liquid nitrogen Store cells until further processing (see chapter Cell extraction suspension cells) The important step here to be quick is the alquotation of the cell suspension and subsequent spin down in the table centrifuge. Suspension cells are rather small, nevertheless \\(3e+6\\) cells per extract are a good starting point for GC-MS measurements. 7.4 Hints &amp; notes The only way to be reproducible and fast is to team up with a second person. Keep timing consistently through the experiment. Keep substrate concentrations constant throughout the experiment in all solutions. Supplement one stable isotopic labeled substrate with all remaining substrates in non-labeled form. Think about nutrient levels in your cell culture and your experimental conditions. Maybe you want to change things to physiological levels. Add additional plate to each condition in order to have material for western blotting and others. Check carefully the confluency of your dishes and determine seeding densities for different conditions. In case of small molecule inhibitors: Try to avoid to solve them in DMSO - strong impact on chromatography. Pelleting these cells and snap-freezing might give usefull additional samples for western blotting.↩ I would rather recommend this up to 2 min of labeling↩ Not required for short term labeling↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ Highly recommended, makes labeling and harvest super quick↩ To generate three replicates↩ Most of the times 30 s are already enough↩ "],
